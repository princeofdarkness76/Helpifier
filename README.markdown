# Welcome to Helpifier

Helpifier is a native OS X client for use with UserScape's [HelpSpot help desk software](http://www.helpspot.com/).

## Requirements

Helpifier requires Mac OS 10.6.

Building Helpifier requires XCode.  (There's not currently a pre-built version available.)

## Usage

Helpifier is a tool we've developed for internal use at [Figure 53](http://figure53.com). Because this is an internal tool, you may bump into some rough spots.  However, we've found it to be quite helpful in keeping our response times fast.

When you first launch Helpifier, you will need to enter your HelpSpot settings.

<ol>
<li>Go to: "Helpifier" --> "Preferences..."</li>
<li>Enter the URLs for your HelpSpot installation.</li>
<li>Enter your HelpSpot username and password.</li>
</ol>

## Credits

The Helpifier application icon was provided by the fine folks at UserScape, and created by [Fixel](http://www.wearefixel.com/).
