# Welcome to Helpifier

Helpifier is a native OS X client for use with UserScape's [HelpSpot help desk software](http://www.helpspot.com/).

## Requirements

Helpifier requires Mac OS 10.6.

Building Helpifier requires XCode.  (There's not currently a pre-built version available.)

## Usage

Helpifier is a tool we've developed for internal use at Figure 53. You'll probably find some rough spots, but we've found it pretty useful.

When you first launch Helpifier, you will need to enter your HelpSpot settings.

<ol>
<li>Go to: "Helpifier" --> "Preferences..."</li>
<li>Enter the URLs for your HelpSpot information.</li>
<li>Enter your HelpSpot username and password.</li>
</ol>

## Credits

The Helpifier icon is something we whipped up using Sensible World's [Symbolicons](http://symbolicons.com/).  Thanks Jory!
